Wage Gap Analysis for Top 5 Occupations in the US

This project was independently completed as a part of my Data Analytics with R course. Using the American Community Survey (ACS) data produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, I set out to determine whether there is a statistical difference between wages of men and women in certain jobs, and if so, how large the gap is. 

This analysis was completed using the statistical computing language R, and I ran a Welch’s Independent Samples t-Test on each of the top 5 occupations in the US. 

The results of my study were unanimous - in every single statistical test I ran for each of the top 5 occupations men came out on top as the higher earner for any job. Each of the Welch’s Independent Samples t-Tests came back with a significant p-value. The magnitude of the pay gap varied from negligible to moderate; for Janitors and Retail Supervisors the pay gap was moderate, for teachers and nurses the pay gap was small, and for cashiers the pay gap was negligible.
